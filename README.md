# Set challenge

The code contained two stes of fruits, some fruits appear in both stes, some only appear in one.

You need to create two more sets called _"duplicate_fruits"_ and _"individual_fruits"_. You must use the appropriate set methods to create these two tuples from the origional two.

Note - each set also contains a non-fruit! Use an appropriate set method to remove the non-fruit item from each one first - you can "hard-code" the value of the item which is not a fruit rather than writing a fancy program to identify it.
